			  loved to read a lot of books since I was a child, and my favourite genre is non-fiction. 
			  I also love arts such as drawing, painting, and music! What inspires me to write the poem
			  "Love that Waits" is that I find it beautiful and romantic how a person can wait an eternity 
			  for someone they love, no matter what the consequences are. This poem has a special place in 
			  my heart because it is my first ever poem and it is based on my own experience.</p>

			  to music and watching anything on the web. I was just bored when I wrote 
			  ‘Bad day’ so I guess I’m not really inspired??? Or maybe I just wanted to express my emotions </p>

              <p>Hi! I'm Ayeza Caryl Basa, I am 17 years old and from  my last name,
			  I like to read but not just any book, I like to read genres that are dark romance,
			  dystopian, and mystery. Sometimes I like to read about love but not the cringe one. 
			  I also like to watch movies so I can be your cinephile buddy. The poem "Wise cat" 
			  that I wrote is a tribute to all the  older siblings out there experience being the 
			  third parent that they forgot they're a son/daughter too. I also am an older sibling so 
			  I know the feeling of being the third parent.</p>

			  sports such as Basketball, Volleyball and Boxing. I used to write this poem using our memories

			  and talked about what we planned for our future until the sun goes down.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm Jonash Linsangan, 17 years old. Nothing interests me that much.
			  All I can say is I like to play video games, play basketball, and cycle. 
			  My favorite theme is romance and fiction. I was motivated to write "Hope Endures"
			  by the perseverance of those I have witnessed overcoming hardship. This poem honors 
			  the human spirit's resilience to overcome adversity and discover hope and courage even 
			  in the most dire circumstances. </p>
